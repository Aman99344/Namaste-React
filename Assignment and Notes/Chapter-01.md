## 3. What is crossorigin in script tag?

The crossorigin attribute sets the mode of the request to an HTTP CORS Request.

Web pages often make requests to load resources on other servers. Here is where CORS comes in.

A cross-origin request is a request for a resource (e.g. style sheets, iframes, images, fonts, or scripts) from another domain.

CORS is used to manage cross-origin requests.

CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, and is a mechanism that allows resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside their own domain. It defines a way of how a browser and server can interact to determine whether it is safe to allow the cross-origin request. CORS allows servers to specify who can access the assets on the server, among many other things.

Tip: The opposite of cross-origin requests is same-origin requests. This means that a web page can only interact with other documents that are also on the same server. This policy enforces that documents that interact with each other must have the same origin (domain).

## 6.  What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?

## 7. What is async and defer?

* Async allows your script to run as soon as it's loaded, without blocking other elements on the page. 
* Defer means your script will only execute after the page has finished loading.
